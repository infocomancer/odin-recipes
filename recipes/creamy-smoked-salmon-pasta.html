        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This smoked salmon pasta is a lighter version of pasta carbonara. For people who want the flavor but not the bacon, smoked salmon is the perfect substitute!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 cups skim milk</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen green peas, thawed and drained</li>
            <li>½ cup canned mushrooms, drained</li>
            <li>10 ounces smoked salmon, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion in butter until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir flour and garlic powder into onion.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir in milk. Heat to just below boiling point, then gradually stir in cheese until sauce is smooth. Stir in peas and mushrooms; cook over low heat until warmed through, about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Toss in smoked salmon and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Serve over pasta.</li>
        </ol>
